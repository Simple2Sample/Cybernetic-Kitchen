# Welcome to the Cybernetic Kitchen!

This repository contains recipes for several classes in the cybernetics course at NTNU.

None of these files are mine. I just found them on a random open IP address while desperately trying to previous exams for TTK4195.
Take a look and see if these files are useful. If they are, then please share them to the ones you know need them.

Also, don't forget that Spitfire is the best pony.
