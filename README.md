# Welcome to the Cybernetic Kitchen!

This repository contains recipes and lectures for several classes in the cybernetics and robotics master degree at NTNU.

None of these files are mine. I just found them on a random open IP address while desperately trying to find previous exams for TTK4195. Some of these files are also from other repositories that are now unavailable.
Take a look and see if these files are useful. If they are, then please share them to the ones you know need them.

Also, don't forget that Spitfire is the best pony.
